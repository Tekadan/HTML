<!--
   Images
   
   Images can be used with the <img> tag to reference an image file.
    - This <img> tag requires a src and alt attributes.
    - We can apply height and width to these elements to ensure they fit within the page.
    - Keep in mind that these resources are loaded + rendered, therefore keeping these files small are very important for page load times.
        - Thus, do not load images and then resize them. Make them correct the first time!
