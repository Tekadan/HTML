    Tables!
    
    Table Structure:
        - Caption: Displays a text field that captions the table
        - Header: Single row that displays headers (if any) (but can be more than one)
        - Body: Actual data content of the table
        - Footer: Single row (but can be more than one) for totals, summaries, etc - shouldn't be used as caption
    
    Working with data in tables:
        - <tr> adds a row to the table, required inside of the header, body, and footer.
        - <th> defines the cell within a <tr> to define the data for the <thead>
        - <td> defines a cell of data within a <tr> inside of the <tbody>
    
    Table Formatting: (Not Formatting WITH Tables)
        - colspan / rowspan allows attributes to be used on table cells that span accross columns or rows.
            - Rowspan is what should be used when you want a single large cell. It's value is how many rows it should span.
        - Cell Padding: the immediate space around the cell itself
        - Cell Spacing: The amount of space between cells (where a cell is considered the td + cell padding)
        - Width: Can be % or px, sets the width of the table as a whole.
