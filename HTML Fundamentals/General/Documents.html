<!-- 
    HTML was created in order to share educational documents
    These were made in mind with text, data, images, and linking them all together
    
    HTML is a markup language - means that it is processed by a client application (or a browser)

<!-- 
    The Anatomy of an HTML Document
    doctype - states the standard of compliance that our html document adheres to
    html - root element to all elements found on the page
        head - document metadata, parsed by browsers and search engines like Google
        body - Displayed to the user by the client browser, where we put our content   
-->

<!-- 
    Minimal Working Product:
    <!DOCTYPE html> <-- HTML5 one and only doctype
    <html>
        <head>
            
        </head>
        
        <body>
            <p>Hello World</p>
        </body>
    </html>
-->

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
    <head>
            
    </head>
        
    <body>
        <p>Hello World</p>
    </body>
</html>
