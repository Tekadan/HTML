        <!-- The <p> tag contains a <div> within it, but it should not contain the div within the <p> element. This will render, but will not pass a validation.

<!--
    Block Vs Inline:
    Block Elements - Container elements for grouping, may contain other block elements and line elements.
        These are wrapped together as a big single element.
    Inline Elements - Container for texts and other inline text. This allows us to treat individual text segments as special styling or links to other pages.
        We CANNOT have a span tag (inline element) that contains a div (block) element.
