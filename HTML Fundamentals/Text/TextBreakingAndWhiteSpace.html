<!-- 
    - Whitespace is generally ignored in block and inline
    - <pre> will force the browser to repsect the whitespace that is included in the .html document
    - <br /> explicit line break, this will force a carrige return
    - <hr /> visible horizontal line to display. This should be done wiht style sheets and not in html now.
    - &nbsp; is a forced white space, cannot be used for line breaks
    - &lt; &gt; entities for HTML markup characters that are otherwise reserved for keywords/tags
